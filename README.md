# spotify-graphql-server

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/lowsky/spotify-graphql-server.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
This demonstrates how to build a GraphQL server which fetches data from an external API (Spotify),
see [blog post](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/01/lets-build-spotify-graphql-server)

Use the [Live Demo](https://spotify-graphql-server.herokuapp.com/) as a playground for graphql queries.

For running this example locally, you need to adapt the [./.env.example] file (see there).
